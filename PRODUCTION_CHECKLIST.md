## 🚨 Pre-Flight Validation Commands

### 1. Environment Validation
```bash
# Check environment file
test -f .env && echo "✅ Environment file exists" || echo "❌ Environment file missing"

# Validate required environment variables
./scripts/validate-env.sh

# Check SSL certificates
test -f ssl/cert.pem && test -f ssl/key.pem && echo "✅ SSL certificates found" || echo "❌ SSL certificates missing"
```

### 2. Service Health Checks
```bash
# Start services
./deploy.sh start

# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 30

# Check service health
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health && echo "✅ Backend healthy" || echo "❌ Backend unhealthy"
curl -f http://localhost:3000 && echo "✅ Frontend healthy" || echo "❌ Frontend unhealthy"

# Check database connectivity
docker-compose exec hnc-database pg_isready -U hnc_user && echo "✅ Database ready" || echo "❌ Database not ready"

# Check Redis connectivity
docker-compose exec hnc-redis redis-cli ping && echo "✅ Redis ready" || echo "❌ Redis not ready"
```

### 3. Security Validation
```bash
# Check for default passwords
grep -q "change_me" .env && echo "❌ Default passwords found" || echo "✅ No default passwords"

# Validate SSL configuration
openssl x509 -in ssl/cert.pem -text -noout | grep -q "Signature Algorithm: sha256" && echo "✅ SSL certificate valid" || echo "❌ SSL certificate invalid"

# Check secret key strength
python -c "
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
secret = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', '')
assert len(secret) >= 32, 'Secret key too short'
print('✅ Secret key strong enough')
"
```

### 4. Performance Validation
```bash
# Check application startup time
time ./deploy.sh start

# Test API response time
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:8000/health

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import os
engine = create_engine(os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
result = engine.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = \\'public\\'')
print(f'✅ Database has {result.fetchone()[0]} tables')
"

# Test data persistence
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer mock_token" \
     -d '{"bioData":{"fullName":"Test Client","maritalStatus":"Single","children":"None"},"financialData":{"assets":[],"liabilities":"","incomeSources":""},"economicContext":{"economicStanding":"Middle Income","distributionPrefs":""},"objectives":{"objective":"Create Will","details":"Test"},"lawyerNotes":"Test"}' \

# Start with previous configuration
./deploy.sh start

# Verify rollback success
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

### Gradual Rollback
```bash
# Scale down new version

# Monitor for issues
./scripts/monitor-health.sh

# If issues persist, complete rollback
./deploy.sh restore /path/to/backup
```
